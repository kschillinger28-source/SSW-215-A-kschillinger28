# SPEC: Developer Portfolio Welcome Page

## 1. Purpose & Scope
- A personal portfolio welcome page for Kurt Schillinger, a software engineering student.
- Non-Goals: no multi-page routing; no backend; no contact forms.

## 2. Invariants & Negative Constraints
- All styling MUST reside in `./style.css` (no inline style="..." attributes).
- The page MUST NOT load external CSS frameworks or CDNs (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind).
- The avatar image MUST use the relative path `./assets/avatar.jpg`.
- The layout MUST collapse into a single vertical column on screens narrower than 768px.
- style.css MUST begin with the universal reset: `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }`.
- Spacing and font sizes MUST use rem. px MAY be used only for borders.
- Styling MUST use class selectors. ID selectors MUST NOT be used for styling.

## 3. UI Content & Interface Contract
- Hero header: my full name "Kurt Schillinger", the subtitle "Software Engineering Student", and this bio: "Passionate about software development and web applications. Currently building hands-on projects and exploring modern developer tools."
- Action link: a button labelled "See my projects" that links to `#projects`.
- Projects section with id="projects": lists these items:
  - Music Discovery App: A Tinder-style swipe interface for discovering songs and curating playlists.
  - Personal Portfolio: A responsive web portfolio built from a strict Markdown specification.
- Social link: GitHub (https://github.com/kschillinger28-source) MUST open in a new tab (target="_blank").
- The page MUST use semantic landmarks: one <header>, one <nav>, one <main>, one <footer>, and each content group inside its own <section> with a heading.
- There MUST be exactly one <h1>, and heading levels MUST NOT skip (h1 then h2 then h3).
- <nav> MUST contain a link to the projects section and a link to my GitHub profile.
- Each project MUST be an <article class="card"> inside a container that uses display: flex, flex-wrap: wrap and gap.
- The "See my projects" button MUST have four visually distinct states: :hover, :focus-visible, :active, and :disabled.
- A second button labelled "Contact me (coming soon)" MUST be present with the HTML disabled attribute, and MUST NOT look clickable.
- All four state rules MUST live in style.css.
